# AI SkillBridge Lectures

This repository contains class lessons and code examples, organized week-wise in subdirectories. Each week folder contains one or more Python projects related to the lessons covered during that week.

## Structure

- `week_01/`  
- `week_02/`  
  - `imdb-semantic-analysis/`  
  - `intro/`  
- ...

Each subdirectory inside a week contains its own Python project, code, and resources.

## How to Access Each Project

1. **Navigate to the desired week folder:**
   ```sh
   cd week_02/imdb-semantic-analysis
   ```
2. **Explore the project files:**
   - Read the `README.md` (if available) for project-specific instructions.
   - Open and run Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks as needed.

3. **Install dependencies:**
   - If a `requirements.txt` is present, install dependencies with:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Repeat for other weeks/projects as needed.**
